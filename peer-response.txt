I like the content of the page. The homepage give the reader a simple but to the point explanation of what this site is about and a little context of the game. For The scalability of the first page, I like how you centered your main content rather than leaving it positioned left and ran the pictures below that. I would suggest maybe adding another break point for your footer information, See attached picture just to give the page a slimmer look when resizing. Another thing which is more cosmetic is the navigational bar rolls over when you shrink the screen size. this leaves the "Home", and "Colors" above your "Basics" bar. Maybe shrinking the nav bars to be smaller would be a good idea. The last thing would be how your nav bar opens another browser tab when you click on them. A user might be frustrated when trying to go from one of your pages to another or back to the last page if it opens a new tab.

 

I could be wrong because I am slightly color blind but the combination of font color and background color is a little hard for me to read. I see how your webpage is coming along and appreciate what you have done so far and I hope I get to see the final project of your website. :)
