        <h3> What is Magic?</h3>
       <h4>
         <ul>  
             <li> Magic is a TCG or Trading Card Game where players collect cards to build their own decks they use to play against each other </li> 
             <li> While certain cards allow you to win in specific ways, the most common goal of the game is to reduce your opponents life total to zero by summoning cratures and casting spells</li> 
             <li> While premise itself is simple, my favorite part of the game is the diverse strategies and synergies that can be used when deckbuilding </li> 
             <li> You can play a complicated deck at relies on a multi card combo over several turn combos or a deck as with a plan as simple as "deal a lot of damage to get rid of my opponent and their creatures" </li>
         </ul>

     A website by Jovani Ruiz. (P.S, I found a character entity that looks like the symbol for one of the most well known factions in Magic's lore: The Pyrexians) &ovbar;

This one uses a URL so you can see it if you want. TLDR they're very deadly monsters, kinda remind me of xenomorphs, but somehow worse.
